# An Analysis of Stocks

## Overview of Project

Client needs assistance in creating VBA scripts in excel spreadsheet for analyzing dataset of stocks.

## Summary and Results

Client requires a way to quickly analyze the stocks in the spreadsheet so he can help his parents make a decision on the stocks they should invest in.  In addition to analyzing he wants everything to be organized and streamlined as possible.  Initially we created macros to analyze a set of stock data in a spreadsheet.  A button was created in order to first analyze the stocks and create a table.  We found that we also needed to format a table so a new macro was written in addition to creating a new button for formatting the table after the stocks were analyzed.  Although this worked well, we needed a way to more quickly run the macro, but also using just one button.  The code was refactored in order to speed up the process and make things more effecient.

### Advantages and Disadvantages in Refactoring:

The advantages of refactoring firstly is the use of less code, making it easier to read and decipher.  The system resources used in running the code would be tasked less, making it more effecient and faster.  The disadvantage is while trying to refactor the code is running into bugs where the code does not working and having to troubleshoot the issue and using up more time.

### Advantages and Disadvantages Refactoring the VBA Script:

The advantage was clear that refactoring the VBA script decreased the time in running the code.  The disadvantage was issues with figuring what code would work, running the code many times, and going back to look at what was wrong.  Overall it did make the script more efficient.

### Results:

#### Result for 2017 Refactored
